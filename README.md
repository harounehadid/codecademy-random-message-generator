## Prerequisites

I should created a message generator that should output a random message made of at least three different peices of data. The nature of the message is up to me.

## My Idea

My idea for this project is that I wanted to create the best quotes that could ever been said. So I thought about it on my own, and come up with the most genius idea ever.
I've gone to blog.hubspot.com and look up the 100 most famous quotes of all time. So as a demo I chose 15 of them that I liked, and split them among ~~us~~ three arrays, and randomly combined between all these components to create the perfect message for you.
I would say I succeeded tremandously... I think.
